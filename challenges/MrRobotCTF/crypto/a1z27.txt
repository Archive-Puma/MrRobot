MrRobotCTF: A1Z27 || Crypto

    The last time I bought from Annazon, we found some rare
    numbers on the ticket that turned out to make sense.
    Yesterday I ordered a package on Amazon.es and
    the ticket has similar numbers but I can't find the meaning.

        13 19 19 16 2 16 21 3 21 6 { 3 16 14 15 4 5 5 20 17 1 15 1 }

    ~ Maybe you can help me ~
