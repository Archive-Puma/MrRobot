### Architecture

- [x] All units must inherit from a template

### Performance

- [x] It is necessary to implement multiprocessing
- [ ] Multiprocessing is executed through priorities
- [x] When a process ends successfully, everyone ends
- [ ] It must be possible to run using an *inline* search method: `FLAG{challenge}`
