## Performance

- [ ] Decompress challenges 
- [x] It is necessary to implement multiprocessing

- [x] It must be possible to run using an *inside* search method: `FLAG{challenge}`
- [x] Should be a *show all results* option

## Refractor & Bugs

- [x] Check imports
- [ ] Create new UnitBase method to convert always to bytes
